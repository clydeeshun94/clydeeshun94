# 👋 Hi, I’m Clyde Eshun


I’m a passionate Full-Stack Developer, problem solver, and creative technologist. I specialize in **web applications, Progressive Web Apps (PWAs), and AI-driven solutions** that are not only functional but provide seamless user experiences.  

I focus on **PWAs** because this is the direction in which web-based development is headed. Unlike traditional mobile apps, PWAs:  
- **Work anywhere:** Accessible on any device with a browser, no app store required  
- **Installable:** Users can add them to their home screen like an app  
- **Fast and reliable:** Offline support and instant loading improve engagement  
- **Cost-effective:** One codebase works across web and mobile  

With PWAs, I deliver app-like experiences while keeping accessibility, performance, and scalability at the forefront.
